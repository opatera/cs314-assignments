      RiverValley BMX is the main track I practice at because it is only
      a few miles away from my house. This track is very fun and technical and
      I get to ride with my friends here very often.

    <div class = "box">
      McCollumn BMX is another track that I practice at a lot because they host
      a huge proam every year with a $20,000 pot. This proam is my favorite
      race that I compete in every year.

      JoeAlbi BMX is the main track I practice at in Spokane when I'm at school.
      The track is under 10 minutes from Gonzaga's campus and has the largest ametuer
      starting gate in the world. The city of Spokane provides a lot of funding to JoeAlbi
      and because of this, JoeAlbi is a very nice facility.
